House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts housing prices based on various factors. By utilizing popular Python libraries and a curated dataset, this project provides a comprehensive solution for real estate price estimation.

Key Components

- Data Collection and Processing: The project uses the "California Housing" dataset from Scikit-learn, which includes features like house age, number of rooms, and median income. Pandas is used to process and transform the data.
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to gain insights into the dataset.
- Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance.
- Regression Model using XGBoost: XGBoost is used to build the regression model, which is known for its ability to handle complex relationships between features.
- Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like R-squared error and mean absolute error, and a scatter plot is created to visualize predicted vs actual prices.

Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries (not needed for Google Colab)
3. Launch Google Colab and open the House_Price_Prediction.ipynb file
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially

Summary
This project provides a practical solution for estimating housing prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging data collection, preprocessing, visualization, XGBoost regression modeling, and model evaluation, this project offers a comprehensive approach to addressing the price predictionÂ task.
